This example demonstrates a potential issue when using `removeIf` and `removeAll` functions in Kotlin with mutable lists.  While both aim to remove elements based on a condition, their behavior can differ, particularly when the condition affects the list size dynamically during the iteration process. The issue arises from modifications affecting the index used for iteration, leading to elements being skipped or incorrectly removed. The provided code showcases this difference and highlights a safer approach.
